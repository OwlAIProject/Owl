# Native Android Version Coming Soon

*Update 2:* There is now a skeleton for displaying conversations. Full companion UI and Bluetooth support coming soon.

*Update:* This project now contains an implementation of Android as a capture device itself. This means it uses the android devices camera and microphone, primarily targeting non phone android devices as wearable/semi-wearable multimodal capture devices. See this [Demo](https://x.com/EthanSutin/status/1763646900056826153?s=20).

In the meantime, you can use the web version on your Android device. WebBluetooth works very well on Android.
