### Getting started with development boards

Designing an AI wearable involves balancing compute power, sensor capabilities, and connectivity to achieve the desired battery life and form factor. Fortunately, there are many development boards available that make it easy to get started and begin field testing. Below are just a few boards we've experimented with for inspiration.
